			<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">My Intrest in Information Technology!</h2>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">Information Technology is an area of business that greatly interests me as it explores and provides many ways of simplifying and developing technology to act in a more effective way. Furthermore, my interest in Information Technology came about during COVID, where I began learning Java online. As I continued to learn Java, I joined discord groups and forums which helped me learn and develop my understanding of Java. </p>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">I chose to change to a Bachelor of IT at RMIT university because of my previous positive experience at the university studying a Bachelor of Business (Human Resources Management). Further, I decided to study IT with RMIT as it is on the forefront of innovation and education in the IT field, additionally their extensive industry connections attracted me to RMIT.</p>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">Throughout my studies I am keen to engage in the innovative and exciting IT knowledge and skills my course will equip me with. Building upon this, I hope to pursue a career in the cyber security industry and know that the Bachelor of IT at RMIT will be an excellent avenue into this field, providing me with the foundations to excel in my dream career. </p>

			<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">My Profile / Personality</h3>
		<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">As shown by the Myers Briggs Test, my personality type is an ESTP-T. ESTP-T are individuals whose strengths involve being rational and practical, perceptive and sociable. In regard to working within a group these attributes will assist in taking change and being able to discuss, develop and guide effective progress to be made. Moreover, the Online Learning Style test deemed that I am a visual learner. This will support my group as I will be able to visualise what our group will need to-do in order to effectively manage and finish our assignment. Lastly, the big 5 personality test has indicated that my top 3 attributes are openness, extraversion and agreeableness. As explored by Corinna E. Löckenhoff<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168724/">¹</a>, the strong attributes of openness, extraversion and agreeableness suit the role of an individual in management as they are able to effective communicate, visualise and predict what must be done within a given timeframe. With this in mind, I suggest I find individual's who are openminded and are open to discussion and differing opinions to allow for different views and perspectives to be explored.

			<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">The Project Idea - "Fingerprint Based Voting Ballot"</h3>

			<b style="font-family:Helvetica;">Overview </b>
			<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">The project idea that I aim to pursue is the concept of a Fingerprint Voting System. This notion involves individuals from a certain group coming to a shared location (e.g. RMIT Building 80) to input their fingerprint in order to cast a vote for a specific vote in a nominated poll. This in turn, will allow for the swift and accurate collection of voters, statistics and results for a particular poll. Lastly, the system, will authenticate a user via their fingerprint so the user is uniquely identified. This is also highly beneficial for the user as their information will be stored and accessed via their fingerprint, thus no information will need to be gathered. </p>

			<b style="font-family:Helvetica;">Motivation </b>
			<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">TThis project would be useful as there is 26.99 million individuals living within Australia, 25.5 million of those being over the age of 18 and legally obligated to vote during elections. This statistic demonstrates the sheer huge potential market that this product could have. Additionally, this product can be used and implemented within elections for PMS and Premiers election and would allow for minimisation of waste of balloting papers and labour numbers involved in calculating ballots. Furthermore, this is a highly cost-effective innovation. Finger printing systems are highly affordable and simple to implement within operating systems. </p>

			<b style="font-family:Helvetica;">Physical Description </b>
			<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">This product will be featured in the shape of a physical booth, providing safe distancing between individuals to ensure the privacy of the voters. The Ballot station will also have a privacy screen to enhance the confidentiality of votes. A privacy screen is a thin sheet of plastic that is placed over a monitor / display in order to prevent the breach of confidential information. Attempting to glance from the right or left angle of this screen will result in the individual being unable to view the screen<a href="https://store.hp.com/us/en/tech-takes/why-do-i-need-computer-privacy-screen#:~:text=A%20computer%20privacy%20screen%2C%20sometimes,eyes%20from%20absorbing%20confidential%20information.&text=Anyone%20attempting%20to%20steal%20a,to%20see%20a%20blank%20screen.">²</a>.  </p>

			<b style="font-family:Helvetica;">Finger Print Description </b>
			<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">As previously discussed, this booth will provide a fingerprint scanner that allows for an individual’s information to be stored remotely. This means that an individual will only have to input their information into the system on a singular occasion. When first using the system, a user will be asked to scan all ten fingers. This aims to counter the potential impact of a damaged finger which cannot be scanned, deeming the fingerprint scanner redundant and unfunctional. </p>

			<b style="font-family:Helvetica;">Software Description </b>
			<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">In regard to software, the balloting station will have a user-friendly design that is aimed to be simple and conventional to allow for individuals to use the balloting station with ease regardless of age or technical ability. Additionally, the software will integrate the storage of user data and information, number of votes and essential information in the functional operation of the product. The product will also have key electronic voting features which will make re-voting and/or individuals voting twice redundant. It will also include key technical integrations, and options for voting to allow for simple and functioning voting. </p>

			<b style="font-family:Helvetica;">Process Description </b>
			<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">The process involved the fingerprint voting booth, will initially involve an individual entering a designated voting location, where they will first sign in. Once completed, the user will proceed to a voting booth in which they will input their respected finger. The console will then procced to provide a pop-up of the user’s information (full name, date of birth and current residential address), they will then be able to confirm their identity and information displayed is accurate. Following this, the user will then cast their votes into the system where the console will log the name, vote’s and time that the ballot was casted. Following, a console screen will appear asking if the users vote is final, if final the user can press ‘confirm’ and leave the designated facility.</p>

			<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">Tools and Technologies</h3>
			<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">For this concept to be functional, significant hardware and software must be developed. The software for this product, must allow for an individual’s data and personal information to be stored and be accessed with individual’s fingerprint. Moreover, the development of a method of storing, counting and limiting the number of votes must be implemented for the product to serve its purpose. Additionally, there will have to be significant amounts of security to allow for the protection of fraudulent voting and activity. In regard to Hardware, physical booth with the implantation of a fully functional fingerprint scanner must be developed and tested. </p>

			<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">Skills Required </h3>
			<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">The skills required for this project will include technical, software and architectural skills. In regard to software skills, a code must be created that allows for data to be stored and accessible from the input of an individual’s fingerprint. Architecturally, a booth concept must be developed that implements the concepts of a finger-print scanner, the physical shape and structure as well as being user friendly. Lastly, the booth must be technically safe and eliminate the potential of fraudulent activity. The feasibility of this is project is limited, as there are a significant number of skills that individuals must have for this to be a reality. Moreover, these individuals will have to work in accordance with one and another to allow for the product to become a reality. </p>

			<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">Outcome</h3>
			<p style="font-family:Helvetica;">If the project is successful, it will allow for the abolishment of Paper balloting systems. This in turn, if integrated correctly will significantly reduce the level of paper wastage (ballots and voting cards), reduce labour costs in counting and sorting votes and eliminate the possibility of the falsification of votes (e.g. voting more than once). This over time will also allow for a reduction in costs for the purchaser as it can be used in numerous situations, where inputs, setting and data can be changed and manipulated for the desired voting poll.</p>
